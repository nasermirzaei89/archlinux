# Arch Linux Installation and Usage Guides

After years, I started to use Arch Linux~~, but in VMWare, because I'm using MacOS on a MacBook Pro.
I miss linux, but I don't have any hardware to install it on.~~. Finally I bought a machine to install it!

This week I had to use linux because I need to work with Hyperledger Caliper, and I had a problem with a dependency that doesn't work with Darwin.
So, I installed Arch Linux and use it.

This time I decided to write everything about the installation and usage of this distro.
I just write least required commands and actions for reaching every goal.
So, these manuals are lighter than the others you have seen.

* [Installation](./installation.md)
* [Add New User](./addUser.md)
* [SSH Server](./sshServer.md)

Let me know if you had any problem in these manuals via [Issues](https://github.com/nasermirzaei89/archlinux/issues).
